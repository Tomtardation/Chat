A simple chat for users to talk to each other. The server and clients will interact with each other in form of binary data through websockets. The server is coded in Python and is asynchronous, serving dynamic webpages through aiohttp and static files TBD.

Users will be able to see chat history and users online in each of their accessible rooms.
